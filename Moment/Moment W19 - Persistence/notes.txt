* Set the project up so that I can project onto the corner roof of my room
	- white solid panels, looking really cool

* But i'm not sure where to take it from there

* I wanna explore the sunlight idea. But frankly, that is a bit hard
	- I should explore that independently, with a simple solid single surface projection i.e. an easy situation, and then take it from there

* So for this corner-roof, if I don't want to do sunlight, then what can I do


* I feel like since my overall panel layout is complex, I don't have much room to make each individual panel complex - might have to keep it simple

* I can do like variations on the constant panel i.e. giving it texture or something

## March 15, 2025

* Brought in the main CompositedPanelAV from Sud

* I think I like the workflow of the main big panel being like the main screen, and the other smaller panels just being constant color panels

* For now, have put in the Individual Lines panels for my main panel

* I think I wanna go in the direction of simpler individual layers, but more number of layers

* Also updated all individual COMPs in CompositedPanelAV to put standin channels when no input is there so that I don't get random output

* For the smaller panels, I think well tuned and sized thin panels looks quite good
	- but can't combine thin panels with solid panels - that doesn't look good


* Looking at Nonotak's works, for the main panel, a bunch of extremely thin indvidual panels might also look really good
	- even for the smaller panels

* And perhaps also the broken lines kinda style

* Also observing that with thin panels, I can only have like one small panel be playing at one time. so for eg, can't have the main panel and a smaller panel both be playing thin panels together

* With just this combination of thin panels and solid panels on all my window panels, with effective and tasteful minimalistic use, I can get a lot of degree of freedom out

## March 20, 2025

* Copied the CompositedPanelsAV i.e. MainV2 for all the projected panels.
	- I really should make it external or Clone or something

* Also need to figure out a proper timeline workflow so that I can actually arrange some sequences in
	- The stepSequencer is fantastic, but i need to figure out how to use it for a period of like 10 or 30 seconds

* Something is off with this Sequencer - if I increase the number of measures, it still ends up taking the same amount of time to go through the entire length, no matter if many measures or few - resulting in each quarter or eight note to get smaller or bigger
	- one stupid workaround is to use a ramp LFO to act as the timer. Then if you double the number of measures, halve the LFO frequency to make sure a single measure takes the same time

### Local Action Vector
* [x] Start using the Cloning/Externalization workflow for the CompositedPanelsAV tox
* [ ] Figure out a nice timeline workflow for writing 30 secondish sequences
* [ ] Overhaul PanelsIndividual to have arbitrary number of panels
* [ ] Make the broken lines style component

* Understood cloning and External Tox workflow
	- Both can work well for me, at least for the case of CompositedPanelsAV
	- However, important to note, with external tox workflow, if I modify a tox, save it, and then reload all of the other copies - it also resets the parm values of all the copies to that of the main saved external tox. To avoid this, and retain your parm values, toggle 'Reload Custom Parameters' and 'Reload Built-In Parameters' to off

* For `CompositedPanelsAV` - i'm going with the workflow of: having one externalized `CompositedPanelsAV.tox` loaded in which will be updated for changes. Making this the master, and making all other clones. Whenever I want to update the component, I just updated the master and save it, that's all
	- Same for `LFOWholePanel` and `PadControlledPanel`

* External toxes over Clones would be great for managing toxes across multiple toe files

* Something is up with my loaded sequencer right now, the sequence doesn't save upon reloading the toe

* An interesting idea with the Sequencers would be to be able to switch through multiple Sequence presets
	- I could achieve that by putting several Sequencers in a Container COMP connected to switches. And from the outside, I could just switch

### local Action Vector
* [x] Fix the Sequencer saving issue
* [ ] Set up switching through Sequencer presets

## March 24, 2025
* The Sequencer bug is happening due to 'Enable External tox' toggle being on
	- Even if I copy and paste the node, the sequence doesn't get saved
	- But if that toggle is off, then it does get saved
	- I suppose this makes sense since the sequence that is drawn in is not one of the parms, but is actually modifying the internal state of the external tox, which if I don't properly save, it resets every time the external tox is loaded
	- So turning that toggle off fixes the issue
	- Interestingly, upon cloning the Sequencers from a main Sequencer, the clones retain their sequence and don't follow the sequence of the master, even upon reloading
	- So to that end, I made a main Master Sequencer and then cloned all of the Sequencers for each panel from that
	- However, it seems like the parms don't work well under cloning. The reset parm wasn't resetting the clones. And if I had the 'Use Input' parm On for the clones, I would get two playheads. Fixed it by making sure that the master also behaves exactly like the clones. I.e. when I reset the clones, I also reset the master. I 'Use Input' on the master, and run its playhead via the LFO
	- Ughh, this Sequencer has issues.
	- And with all the above, I'm still seeing issues

## March 25, 2025

* The bug with the Sequencer happens in part due to the fact that the parameters of the component control and change the physical network inside the component due to replicators and scripts, changing the number of nodes, connections and all - so I guess if the tox is external and I don't save it each time I quit, that somehow ends up with issues

* The shitty solution for now is to not have the Master be an external tox. But the clones are still cloned, so I have at least that workflow
	- actually, this doesn't work either

## March 26, 2025
* For the Sequencer - screw external tox and cloning for now - we'll just copy it all
	- had to re copy all the sequencers cause the earlier external and cloning toggling on was making the existing ones misbehave

* Messed around with putting the Sequencers inside a Container and building the long Sequencer UI that way. Honestly, kinda working
	- I actually quickly made one
	- It's got scrollbars and fixed perfectly in the screen. Very Very good
