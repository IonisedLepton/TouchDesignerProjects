* Set the project up so that I can project onto the corner roof of my room
	- white solid panels, looking really cool

* But i'm not sure where to take it from there

* I wanna explore the sunlight idea. But frankly, that is a bit hard
	- I should explore that independently, with a simple solid single surface projection i.e. an easy situation, and then take it from there

* So for this corner-roof, if I don't want to do sunlight, then what can I do


* I feel like since my overall panel layout is complex, I don't have much room to make each individual panel complex - might have to keep it simple

* I can do like variations on the constant panel i.e. giving it texture or something

* Brought in the main CompositedPanelAV from Sud

* I think I like the workflow of the main big panel being like the main screen, and the other smaller panels just being constant color panels

* For now, have put in the Individual Lines panels for my main panel

* I think I wanna go in the direction of simpler individual layers, but more number of layers

* Also updated all individual COMPs in CompositedPanelAV to put standin channels when no input is there so that I don't get random output
