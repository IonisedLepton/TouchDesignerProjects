* Really liking the effect of bloom on the striations. 

* But i've gotta find a way to make the striations more controllable. 
	- Some controls that would lend well to being visualised with music
	- Right now it is too noise like

* I'm thinking next for striations I would wanna try,
	- running it through feedback maybe. Not too hopeful that this will be good, but worth a shot
	- compositing multiple striations

* Maybe for making striations controllable, I don't necessary need to make it 'controllable' at the source, but instead given how it is right now, I can process it through 'effects' allowing it to be controllable, for eg compositing it in a controllable way
	- for eg, comping it with the ramp phaser makes it very controllable and good
	- similarly it can maybe comped with panels

* The Ramp phaser pattern is very cool too.
	- It would look fantastic at high rates with arpeggios or tremolos
	- very hypnotic

* The point cloud with the basic Calibration image is looking so so good
	- I've gotta find some way of harnessing and making this work for my goals

* Point Cloud is actually not looking too good with striations
