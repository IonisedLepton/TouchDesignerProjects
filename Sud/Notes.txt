* The workflow could be:
* Constrain the complexity of each network. If it looks to be getting too complex, bin into smaller toxes

* For each Main tox - restrict your Degree of Freedom by exposing out a few parms out to the parent tox - and only animate those parms. 
	- So stick to this restriction
	- If you want more degree of freedom, make a new tox, expose out more parms and animate those. Don't animate parms in the tox

* So in this toe file, i'm starting with the MainV2 COMP, which is a simpler version of MainV1
	- for all controls for the panels, I will expose out parameters instead of letting in input
	- I want this to be a generator, that's why to control the panels, instead of inputting a chop with channels, I will use the parms to control them
	- These parms will be well organized on the parm page
	- And then from the outside you can use a constant going into a null with the null being bound to the parms

* For the Individual Panels, instead of controlling them via parms, using an individual in chop for each of them cause that makes more sense

* Need to modify the Panel toxes to be not tied to 4 panels

* Trying to use the Animation COMP to come up with some animation, but man it feels quite clunky. Not the most natural way
	- some sort of sequencing workflow would be so good actually
