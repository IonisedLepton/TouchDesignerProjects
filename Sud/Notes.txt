* The workflow could be:
* Constrain the complexity of each network. If it looks to be getting too complex, bin into smaller toxes

* For each Main tox - restrict your Degree of Freedom by exposing out a few parms out to the parent tox - and only animate those parms. 
	- So stick to this restriction
	- If you want more degree of freedom, make a new tox, expose out more parms and animate those. Don't animate parms in the tox

* So in this toe file, i'm starting with the MainV2 COMP, which is a simpler version of MainV1
	- for all controls for the panels, I will expose out parameters instead of letting in input
	- I want this to be a generator, that's why to control the panels, instead of inputting a chop with channels, I will use the parms to control them
	- These parms will be well organized on the parm page
	- And then from the outside you can use a constant going into a null with the null being bound to the parms

* For the Individual Panels, instead of controlling them via parms, using an individual in chop for each of them cause that makes more sense

* Need to modify the Panel toxes to be not tied to 4 panels

* Trying to use the Animation COMP to come up with some animation, but man it feels quite clunky. Not the most natural way
	- some sort of sequencing workflow would be so good actually

* Added the 'Perspective Rectangle' tox, and put it in MainV2

## February 06, 2025
* To use the 'Input' parm that I added on my COMPs to get the CHOP input via a parm instead of the input - since TD doesn't have a direct way of making the CHOP from the op path, I created a script CHOP in 'perspectiveRectangles' COMP to create the CHOP channels from the input path
	- Honestly, working really well
	- I could use this for other toxes of mine

* Added an Annotate Parm in the tox to keep track of version. Need a better workflow, but this is fine for now

## February 12, 2025
* Overhauled the LFOWholePanel toxes to not be tied to 4 panels

## March 04, 2025
* Added the Input parm to individual panels too

* Mapped all the keyboard ins to the input constant for some testing and such

* Now, I really need to think about the goal and big picture, and take this COMP there. Right now it doesn't really do anything
